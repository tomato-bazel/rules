## 0.10.0 — `cfn_join`: Fn::Join, and list-valued GetAtt in an Output

- New `cfn_join(delimiter, values)` Starlark helper in
  `cloudformation/stack.bzl`, rewritten by the aggregator into
  `{"Fn::Join": [delimiter, <values>]}`.
- The gap it closes: a CFN `Outputs.*.Value` must be a **string**, and
  several `Fn::GetAtt` attributes are **lists** —
  `AWS::Route53::HostedZone.NameServers` most visibly. Emitted bare, such
  an output builds clean, deploys, and then rolls the stack back with
  *"Template format error: Every Value member must be a string."*, which
  names neither the output nor the attribute. Nothing upstream catches
  it: the typed rules check property types rather than output values,
  and the aggregator validates that a `cfn_getatt` names a real resource
  but has no notion of that attribute's type.
- **Two forms**, distinguished by the Starlark type of `values` and
  encoded in two separate sentinels (`@@cfn:join:` /
  `@@cfn:joinlistref:`), because both reach the aggregator as a flat
  string with nothing left to infer from:
  - a **list** of literals and/or sentinels →
    `{"Fn::Join": [d, [v1, v2, …]]}`;
  - a **single** `cfn_ref` / `cfn_getatt` / `cfn_import_value` /
    `cfn_find_in_map` sentinel that is itself list-valued →
    `{"Fn::Join": [d, {"Fn::GetAtt": […]}]}`.

  Wrapping the second form's argument in a one-element list renders
  `[d, [{"Fn::GetAtt": …}]]` — a list of one element that happens to be
  a list, not a list-valued reference — which fails the same template
  format error the join was added to fix, and reads as correct.
- Nested sentinels inside a list are rewritten normally, so `cfn_ref`,
  `cfn_getatt`, `cfn_import_value` and `cfn_find_in_map` all compose, and
  their names are validated as anywhere else (`… BucketName[1] points at
  a name that isn't in the stack`).
- The Join separator is the **Record** Separator (`\036`), deliberately
  not `cfn_find_in_map`'s Unit Separator (`\037`): a `cfn_find_in_map`
  nested in a join's value list arrives carrying `\037` inside its own
  sentinel, and sharing the character would shred it into fragments that
  match no prefix and render as literal strings — a silently vanished map
  lookup. Join-inside-Join is the case two characters cannot rescue, so
  `cfn_join` rejects it outright rather than mis-splitting it.
- Rejected at Bazel-load time, each with a message naming the fix: an
  empty `values` list (an empty join evaluates to `""`, so a list
  comprehension that matched nothing would render an empty property
  rather than an error), a single value that is a literal or a
  string-valued sentinel (`cfn_sub` / `cfn_base64` / `cfn_join` — CFN
  rejects all three as `Fn::Join`'s second argument), a nested
  `cfn_join`, a dict element such as `cfn_if(...)`, and a delimiter or
  value containing the separator.
- Closes #6.

## 0.9.0 — `resource_depends_on`: explicit DependsOn

- `cloudformation_stack`: new `resource_depends_on` attr, a `string_dict` of
  resource `label.name` -> comma-separated resource names it must be
  created after. Emits `DependsOn:`. A single dependency renders as a
  bare string, several as a sorted list — both valid CFN, with the
  string form matching what hand-authored templates use so a generated
  template stays diffable against the one it replaces.
- Only needed where the ordering is real but no value flows between the
  two resources, so CFN cannot infer it from a `cfn_ref`/`cfn_getatt`
  edge. The canonical case, which every VPC hits, is `AWS::EC2::Route`
  with a `GatewayId`: it and the `AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment` both
  merely `Ref` the gateway, so both depend on IT and neither on the
  OTHER. CFN is then free to create the route first, which fails with
  *"The gateway ID 'igw-…' does not exist or is not attached"*. AWS
  documents the dependency as required. Being a race, it can pass once
  and fail on the next rebuild — which is why the new smoke test locks a
  byte-stable template rather than relying on a deploy that worked.
- Every name is validated against the stack's resources at build time,
  matching `resource_conditions`. Unknown target, unknown dependency,
  self-dependency and malformed input are each a hard failure — a
  typo'd `DependsOn` is otherwise silent and reinstates the exact race
  it was added to remove.
- Closes #1.

## 0.8.0 — cloudformation_up: in-place `--use-previous-template`

- `cloudformation_up`: add a `use_previous_template` attribute. When
  set, `stack` is omitted and the launcher deploys with
  `--use-previous-template` instead of `--template-file` — an in-place
  update of an already-deployed stack that reuses its live template and
  leaves every unspecified parameter at its previous value. Pass the
  values to change via `parameter_overrides` (or `bazel run … --
  --parameter-overrides Key=Value`). `stack` and `use_previous_template`
  are mutually exclusive; exactly one is required.
- This lets a repo flip a single parameter (e.g. a container image tag)
  on a stack whose template another repo owns, without vendoring the
  whole template.
- `cloudformation_stack`: Conditions + Mappings support. New
  `cloudformation_condition` and `cloudformation_mapping` rules emit
  top-level `Conditions` / `Mappings` blocks; new `conditions` /
  `mappings` / `resource_conditions` attrs on `cloudformation_stack`
  (the last attaches a `Condition:` to a resource, validated against the
  declared conditions). New `cfn_find_in_map(...)` sentinel (rewrites to
  `Fn::FindInMap`, accepts nested `cfn_ref`) and `cfn_equals` / `cfn_and`
  / `cfn_or` / `cfn_not` / `cfn_if` condition-function helpers. `cfn_ref`
  now also accepts CFN pseudo-parameters (`AWS::Region`, …) without
  failing name validation. This closes the gap that forced hand-authored
  YAML for templates using Conditions/Mappings.

## 0.6.0 — deploy wrappers (cloudformation_up / cloudformation_down)

- New `cloudformation_up` and `cloudformation_down` executable
  rules in `cloudformation/deploy.bzl`. `bazel run :foo_up` deploys
  the stack via the aws CLI's `cloudformation deploy`;
  `bazel run :foo_down` calls `delete-stack`. Extra argv after
  `--` flows through to the aws CLI.
- New aws CLI toolchain abstraction
  (`cloudformation/aws_cli/toolchain_type.bzl`). The default
  toolchain (`@rules_cloudformation//cloudformation/aws_cli:default_aws_cli_toolchain`,
  auto-registered) is a thin `sh_binary` around system `aws` on
  PATH — friendliest for dev + CI runners that already have aws
  CLI installed. Consumers can register their own toolchain (e.g.
  multitool-fetched, http_file, sidecar Docker) and Bazel's
  toolchain resolution will prefer it without any changes to the
  deploy rules.
- Deploy rule attrs: `stack` (the cloudformation_stack target;
  mandatory), `stack_name` (defaults to label.name), `region`,
  `capabilities` (list — e.g. `["CAPABILITY_IAM"]`),
  `parameter_overrides` (string_dict).
- Smoke targets exercise the launcher generation end-to-end
  (build-only — no real AWS calls in CI).

## 0.5.0 — cross-resource refs (cfn_ref / cfn_getatt)

- New `cfn_ref(resource_name)` and `cfn_getatt(resource_name,
  attribute)` Starlark helpers in `cloudformation/stack.bzl`. They
  return sentinel strings (`@@cfn:ref:Name`,
  `@@cfn:getatt:Name.Attr`) that the aggregator rewrites into
  `{"Ref": ...}` / `{"Fn::GetAtt": [...]}` CFN intrinsic dicts at
  template-render time.
- Aggregator validates that every sentinel points at a name in the
  stack's resource set — typos fail the Bazel build with a
  `$.Resources.X.Properties.Y` breadcrumb instead of a deferred
  AWS-side template rejection.
- Smoke stack now exercises both helpers: a `BucketPolicy` whose
  `Bucket` is `cfn_ref("SmokeBucket")` and whose policy statement
  references `cfn_getatt("SmokeBucket", "Arn")`. Expected JSON
  updated.

## 0.4.0 — cloudformation_stack aggregator

- New `cloudformation_stack` rule (`cloudformation/stack.bzl`) —
  takes typed-rule shards (from `defs.bzl`) and intrinsic shards
  (from `intrinsics.bzl`) and renders one CFN template:
  `Resources.X = {Type, Properties}` per resource, Init shards
  spliced under `Resources.<target>.Metadata.AWS::CloudFormation::Init`,
  Interface shards spliced under template-level
  `Metadata.AWS::CloudFormation::Interface`. Optional
  `description` attr fills the template's `Description` field.
- New generated `cfn_types.bzl` (snake-id → `AWS::Service::Resource`
  map for all 1582 spec rules) — needed because snake-case loses
  the segment boundaries that distinguish e.g.
  `ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalableTarget` from
  `Application::AutoScalingScalableTarget`. Regenerated alongside
  `defs.bzl` via `bazel run //cloudformation:update`.
- Smoke stack in `examples/smoke` aggregates an S3 bucket + EC2
  instance + Init metadata + Interface block into one template,
  byte-stable `diff_test` against committed expected JSON.
- **Phase-1 limitations** — the aggregator uses each contributing
  rule's `label.name` as the CFN logical id (so Bazel targets must
  be PascalCase and alphanumeric). The `<kind_id>_name` custom-name
  attr on the typed rules is unused for now. Cross-resource
  refs (`Ref` / `Fn::GetAtt`) and deploy wrappers
  (`cloudformation_up` / `_down`) are deferred to later phases.

## 0.3.1 — CFN intrinsics (Init, Interface)

- New `cloudformation/intrinsics.bzl` with two hand-authored rules
  for the CFN metadata directives that live outside the Resource
  Spec:
  - `cloudformation_aws_cloudformation_init` — emits the
    `AWS::CloudFormation::Init` config-set tree (configSets +
    named config blocks) that `cfn-init` interprets at instance
    boot. Carries a `target_resource_name` for the future stack
    aggregator to attach the shard under the right resource's
    `Metadata`.
  - `cloudformation_aws_cloudformation_interface` — emits the
    `AWS::CloudFormation::Interface` template-level metadata
    that groups Parameters into labelled sections for the AWS
    console UI.
- Smoke tests in `examples/smoke` cover both with byte-stable
  `diff_test` gates.

Purely additive — no changes to the spec-derived rules in
`defs.bzl`. Consumers wanting the intrinsics
`load("@rules_cloudformation//cloudformation:intrinsics.bzl", ...)`
alongside the existing `defs.bzl` load.

## 0.3.0 — exhaustive coverage via rules_jsonschema auto-kinds

- Switched from 6 hand-curated service groups to a **single
  assembler invocation covering the entire CFN Resource Spec**,
  driven by rules_jsonschema v0.3's new auto-kinds flags
  (`--kinds-pointer-base`, `--kinds-key-filter`, the template
  flags). Result: **1582 typed Bazel rules** across every
  `AWS::Service::Resource` in the pinned spec (was 26).
- Adding a new resource type is now a no-op — bump the upstream
  spec pin in `cfn_sources_extension` and the new resources show
  up in the regenerated `defs.bzl`.
- `defs.bzl` is now the generated artifact (was a hand-written
  re-export shim over 6 per-group `.bzl` files). The per-group
  files (`storage.bzl`, `compute.bzl`, …) are removed.
- **Breaking**: the per-kind item-name attr is now namespaced with
  the full `aws_service_resource` id (e.g. `aws_s3_bucket_name`)
  rather than the v0.2 short tag (`bucket_name`). The change
  prevents collisions across the 1500+ resource set; the v0.2
  short-tag form wasn't unique once coverage expanded past one
  service per "kind concept" (S3, EC2, and S3Outposts all have
  "bucket"-ish resources, etc.).
- Endpoint-description overlay (`cfn_overlay_descriptions`)
  preserved against the new single `assembled_all` target;
  `AWS::S3::Bucket` retains its rich property docs. Endpoint
  coverage for additional resources is still pin-per-resource in
  `cloudformation/private/extensions.bzl`.

## 0.2.0 — 6 groups, 26 typed rules, docstring overlay

- Scaled the codegen pipeline from one S3 Bucket rule to **26
  typed Bazel rules across 6 resource-type groups**:
  - `storage` — AWS::S3::Bucket / BucketPolicy / AccessPoint
  - `compute` — Lambda Function/Permission, ECS Service/Cluster/TaskDefinition, ECR Repository
  - `identity` — IAM Role/Policy/ManagedPolicy/User/Group
  - `messaging` — SQS Queue/QueuePolicy, SNS Topic/Subscription/TopicPolicy, EventBridge EventBus/Rule
  - `observability` — CloudWatch Logs LogGroup/LogStream, CloudWatch Alarm
  - `database` — DynamoDB Table/GlobalTable
- One `cfn_assemble` + `jsonschema_starlark_codegen` pair per
  group, emitting `cloudformation/<group>.bzl`. Each gated by
  its own `diff_test`. `bazel run //cloudformation:update`
  regenerates all groups.
- **`cfn_overlay_descriptions`** (`cloudformation/private/overlay.bzl`)
  layers AWS-endpoint per-resource property descriptions on top
  of the assembler-derived schema before codegen. Trades URL-only
  attr docs for rich prose. v0.2 pins endpoint coverage for
  `AWS::S3::Bucket`; expanding to other resources is a one-line
  pin per resource in `cloudformation/private/extensions.bzl`.
- `defs.bzl` re-exports every group's rules + providers, so
  consumers only need one `load(...)` call.
- Internal cleanup: dropped unused `cfn_template_schema_src` from
  `use_repo`; trimmed stale Java language-version pins from
  `.bazelrc` (kept only the runtime pin needed for the remote JDK).

## 0.1.0 — (retag) Java-assembler-based schema source

- Pivoted the schema source from the per-resource AWS endpoint
  (`schema.cloudformation.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/*.json`) to the
  upstream Java assembler in
  `aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-template-schema`, run at
  build time against a sha-pinned snapshot of the AWS
  CloudFormation Resource Specification (us-east-1, sha256
  `3bf0f8b5...`). This aligns the source of truth with cfn-lint
  and the CFN Linter docs.
- New module extension `cfn_sources_extension` (in
  `cloudformation/private/extensions.bzl`) — `http_archive`s the
  upstream source tarball (commit `5d7815b1...`) and `http_file`s
  the Resource Specification.
- New `cfn_assemble` custom rule (in
  `cloudformation/private/assemble.bzl`) — runs the assembler with
  a synthesized YAML config that pins region → local-file URI and
  declares a single custom resource group. Output: one
  `<group>-spec.json` consumable by
  `jsonschema_starlark_codegen`.
- Assembler sources are vendored in delomboked form under
  `cloudformation/private/assembler_src/` because Bazel 9.1.0's
  rules_java toolchain runs JavaBuilder on remotejdk25, and Lombok
  has no JDK-25-compatible release. The trade-off + refresh
  procedure is in `docs/SCHEMA_SOURCE.md`.
- One local Codegen patch: `addPrimitiveType` falls back to "Json"
  when the upstream-treated-as-primitive `propType` is null (newer
  CFN spec entries can have `Type: Json` with no `PrimitiveType`
  set — upstream NPEs on these).
- `cloudformation_aws_s3_bucket` rule re-derived from the
  assembled `storage` group's schema; the emitted JSON shard
  byte-matches the v0.0.1/early-v0.1 output for the smoke test
  inputs.

## 0.0.1 — scaffold

- Initial scaffold via `rels scaffold`. No public API yet.
