PEP 425 / PEP 600 tag matching, kept *narrow* relative to rules_python:
we score on (platform, abi, python) priority and return the wheel

like:

Each of the three tag fields may be `.`-separated (a single wheel
can declare compatibility with multiple Python versions, ABIs, or
platforms). For each field we expand and pick the best match
against the host's ordered tag list; if any field has no match,
the wheel is skipped.
