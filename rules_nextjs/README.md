# rules_nextjs

Bazel rules for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Runs `next build` as a
hermetic Bazel action with the workspace's deps as explicit inputs and
the `.next/` tree as the declared output.

- **rule**: `next_build` — see [docs/defs.md](docs/defs.md).
- **rule/macro**: `next_standalone` — turn an `output = "standalone"` build into a `bazel run`-able server **and** a deployable bundle for `pkg_tar`/`oci_image`.
- **provider**: `NextBuildInfo` — wraps the `.next` output tree so future rules (deploy targets, `oci_image` wrappers, doc-site extractors) can consume builds programmatically.

## Install

Add the registry to your `.bazelrc`:

```
common --registry=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fastverk/bazel-registry/main/
common --registry=https://bcr.bazel.build/
```

In your `MODULE.bazel`:

```python
bazel_dep(name = "rules_nextjs", version = "0.1.0")
```

You'll also need `aspect_rules_js` (or equivalent) to expose `next` as a `js_binary`-compatible target — this rule consumes the CLI via `next_bin`, doesn't bring its own.

## Quick start

```python
load("@npm//:my-app/next/package_json.bzl", next_bin_gen = "bin")
load("@rules_nextjs//next:defs.bzl", "next_build")

# Real js_binary wrapping node_modules/next/dist/bin/next. The rule needs
# an executable target — `:node_modules/next/dir` is a directory and
# cannot be exec'd directly. aspect_rules_js generates `bin.next_binary`
# for any npm package that declares a bin in its package.json.
next_bin_gen.next_binary(name = "next_cli")

next_build(
    name = "build",
    srcs = glob(["src/**/*", "public/**/*"]) + [
        "next.config.ts",
        "tsconfig.json",
    ],
    deps = [
        "//packages/some-lib:lib",
        ":node_modules/next",
        ":node_modules/react",
        ":node_modules/react-dom",
    ],
    data = [
        # Runtime assets dropped into public/ before the build.
        "//db/migrations:bundle",
    ],
    next_bin = ":next_cli",
)
```

`bazel build //:build` produces `bazel-bin/build.out/` containing the full
`.next/` tree (`standalone/`, `static/`, trace files).

## Standalone: runnable server + deployable bundle

`next build`'s `output: 'standalone'` emits the self-contained server
(`.next/standalone`) and the hashed client assets (`.next/static`) as
*siblings* — neither runs on its own. `next_standalone` re-stitches them
into one tree (matching the hand-written `Dockerfile` COPY layout) and
exposes it two ways:

```python
load("@rules_nextjs//next:defs.bzl", "next_build", "next_standalone")

next_build(
    name = "build",
    # ... as above ...
    output = "standalone",  # the default; static/vercel get no runnable
    next_bin = ":next_cli",
)

next_standalone(
    name = "app",
    build = ":build",
    next_bin = ":next_cli",  # borrowed for the hermetic Node
)
```

- `bazel run //:app` — serve the app on the hermetic Node (honors
  `PORT` / `HOSTNAME`).
- `//:app.bundle` — a `TreeArtifact` ready for an image:

  ```python
  load("@rules_pkg//pkg:tar.bzl", "pkg_tar")
  load("@rules_oci//oci:defs.bzl", "oci_image")

  pkg_tar(name = "app_layer", srcs = ["//:app.bundle"], package_dir = "/app")
  oci_image(
      name = "image",
      base = "@distroless_nodejs",
      tars = [":app_layer"],
      workdir = "/app",
      # The bundle drops a fixed-name entry shim at its root (it discovers the
      # nested server.js for you), so the cmd never changes per app:
      cmd = ["__next_standalone_server.cjs"],
  )
  ```

The standalone server resolves `/_next/static/*` relative to the cwd, so
the runnable and the entry shim both `cd` to the bundle root, where
`.next/static` is re-stitched.

> `next_build` repairs the standalone `node_modules` so dynamic runtime
> requires (e.g. `next`'s require-hook → `styled-jsx`) resolve — without
> it the deref'd standalone crashes on boot. The trade-off is a heavier
> `node_modules` than a pnpm-built standalone; see the CHANGELOG `0.3.0`
> note.

## Hermeticity

The rule forces three Next.js env vars:

- `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
- `NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE=1`
- `NODE_ENV=production`

The rest of the hermeticity scrub lives in each app's `next.config.ts` — `rules_nextjs` deliberately doesn't try to patch from the outside. Consumer-side checklist:

| Bring under control | How |
| --- | --- |
| Font CDN fetches | Vendor under `public/fonts/` or use `next/font/local`; `next/font/google` reaches `fonts.googleapis.com` at build time |
| Image optimizer pre-fetches | `images: { unoptimized: true }` or explicit `remotePatterns` |
| Build-time network from instrumentation | Audit `instrumentation*.ts` for module-init side effects |
| Next version | Pin via root `package.json` catalog |

Validate the scrub by building with `--network none` after the migration lands.

## Compatibility

- **Bazel**: 7.4+, bzlmod required.
- **Next.js**: 14+ tested. Earlier versions may work — `next build <app-dir>` and the env-var contract have been stable.
- **Workspace shape**: assumes `aspect_rules_js`-style npm linking (`:node_modules/next/dir`).
