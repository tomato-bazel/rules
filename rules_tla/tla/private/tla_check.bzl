"""tla_check — model-check a TLA+ spec with TLC as a `bazel test` target.

Implemented as a build action that runs TLC and writes a marker file, gated by a
`build_test`. Running TLC in an action (rather than a test binary) means we use
exec-config file paths directly — no runfiles/rlocation wiring — and the JDK comes
from Bazel's built-in java runtime toolchain.
