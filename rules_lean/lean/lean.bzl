"""Bazel rules for Lean 4.

User-facing rules:
  lean_toolchain         — registers a Lean compiler binary + runtime tree.
                           Normally produced by `lake_workspace` (see lake.bzl);
                           can also be declared by hand against a hermetic
                           lean tarball.
  lean_prebuilt_library  — exposes a tree of prebuilt .olean files as a
                           LeanInfo provider consumable via the `deps` attr.
                           The `path_marker` file's parent directory becomes
                           the LEAN_PATH entry.
  lean_library           — compile a set of .lean sources to a persistent
                           .olean import-root tree (build outputs) and expose
                           it as LeanInfo. Lets one module be a *compiled*
                           dep of another (no source re-sharing). Transitive:
                           its LeanInfo carries its deps' closure too.
  lean_olean_archive     — bundle a lean_library's own .olean tree into a
                           tarball — the deployable cross-repo release artifact.
  lean_imported_library  — expose an unpacked .olean tarball (e.g. from an
                           `http_archive` of a release asset) as LeanInfo,
                           with NO recompile. The cross-repo consume side.
  lean_test              — stages a set of .lean sources into a module-path
                           layout and invokes the compiler on an entry point.
                           Returns 0 if all type-check, nonzero otherwise.
                           Accepts `deps = [LeanInfo]` and prepends each
                           dep's import root to LEAN_PATH.
  lean_emit              — like lean_test, but the entry file defines
                           `main : IO Unit`; runs it and captures stdout to
                           a declared output file. The Lean kernel becomes
                           the source of truth for emitted artifacts (SQL,
                           TTL, Markdown). Same `deps` plumbing as lean_test.
  lean_axiom_test        — assert that each named theorem's TRANSITIVE axiom
                           dependencies are inside an allowlist, and fail the
                           build otherwise. The check a proof repository
                           actually wants: `#print axioms` prints, it does not
                           gate.

Two things every rule here now does, which none of them did before 0.7.0:

  * compiler diagnostics are forwarded even on a SUCCESSFUL compile. `lean`
    exits 0 on a `sorry` (it is a warning) and on `#print axioms`, and the
    driver only echoed output when the exit code was non-zero — so both
    vanished. A `sorry` was a green, silent build.
  * `forbid_sorry` (default True) makes an admitted goal a build failure.

`lean_library`/`lean_olean_archive`/`lean_imported_library` (added 0.4.0) are
the cross-repo compiled-artifact seam: split a monolithic Lean library into
modules, publish each module's `.olean` tree as a per-`(lean-version, os, arch)`
release tarball, and have downstreams consume the prebuilt oleans without
recompiling. `.olean` is neither Lean-version- nor architecture-portable (it is
a compacted heap image), so a consumer must pin the SAME `lean-toolchain` and
`select()` the matching-platform artifact; Lean itself rejects a mismatched
olean loudly at use.

    Lean resolves a module name in the FIRST `LEAN_PATH` root that owns its

    namespace has to end up in exactly one place, and there are two ways it can
    be split across more than one:

      * the CONSUMER also has sources under it — the original case;
      * TWO OR MORE DEPS own it — e.g. two published modules both rooted at
        `Pg/`. Handling only the first case made this a silent failure:
        modules from the second dep resolve to the first dep's root and the
        compile dies with "object file ... does not exist" naming a path inside
        the wrong repository.

    Either way the answer is to `stage` — copy those oleans into the compile
    root so they merge into a single tree. Only namespaces owned by exactly one
    dep and untouched by the consumer can safely go on `leanpath` (no copy).

# The check runs at ELABORATION time, inside the same Lean process that just
# compiled the proof, via `Lean.collectAxioms` — the identical API backing
# `#print axioms`. So it agrees with the hand audit by construction rather than
# by re-implementing it, and it is transitive: an axiom reached through any
# depth of imported lemmas is reported at the theorem.
#
# Two axioms are worth naming because they are what an allowlist is FOR:
#   * `sorryAx`           — an admitted goal. The theorem is not proved.
#   * `Lean.ofReduceBool` — a `native_decide`. The claim rests on the compiler
#                           and the runtime rather than on the kernel.
# Neither is in the default allowlist, so both fail unless asked for by name.
# =============================================================================

# Lean's three standard axioms — classical logic with quotient types, which is
# what ordinary mathematics in Lean 4 assumes. This is the default because it
# is the allowlist essentially every "no `sorry`, no `native_decide`" audit
# actually wants, and because writing it out is how `sorryAx` gets excluded.
