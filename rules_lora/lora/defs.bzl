* `lora_dataset`, `lora_recipe`, `lora_base_model` — thin
  re-exports of the underlying rules.
* `lora_train` — v0.0.2: now a macro. Always emits the typed
  jobspec; additionally composes with `@rules_runpod` when
  `backend = "runpod"` to emit a synthesized manifest +
  `runpod_job`, giving the user `bazel run :<name>.runpod_job.run`.
* `lora_merge` — v0.0.34: fold a trained adapter into its base and
  export a standalone HF model dir (`bazel run :<name>.run`), with an
  optional HF push. Carries `LoraBaseModelInfo` so the merged model is
  usable directly as a `lora_train(base = ...)` (two-stage rebase).
* `expert_manifest` — bundle N adapters as the routing input.

Macros forward to rules in `//lora/private:rules.bzl`, which fill
providers from `//lora/private:providers.bzl`.

    The **backend is selected per-platform**, not per-target:

        bazel build :<name> --platforms=@rules_lora//lora/backend:local_platform

    emits the typed `lora.v1.TrainingJobSpec` JSON (`<name>.jobspec.json`) tagged
    with the resolved backend. The runnable `:<name>.run` dispatches on the same

      * runpod -> `:<name>_runpod_job.run` (synthesized manifest + @rules_runpod)
      * modal  -> `:<name>_modal` (stub; not yet implemented)

    All three run entries are emitted regardless of platform (analysis-only for
    the inactive ones); the `select()` picks the one matching the build, so the
    run side and the toolchain-resolved build side agree on one platform choice.
